# Covid-Visualization
This project performs data analysis using statistical analytics methods and creates a dashboard to display the insights. The data used in this project was taken from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and includes COVID-19 deaths and cases by country and continent.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- MySQL
- Tableau Public

## Installation
To use this project, you must have an internet connection to access Tableau Public. No additional installations are required.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning and preparation was done using Python and its libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The data was first cleaned, removing any missing or duplicated values, and then transformed into a format suitable for analysis. The details of the data cleaning process can be found in the "Data Cleaning.ipynb" file in the Python files folder.

## Data Analysis and Dashboard
The cleaned data was then analyzed using statistical analytics methods, and a dashboard was created using Tableau Public to display the insights gained. The dashboard includes charts of death and infection rates in different countries and continents, as well as how COVID-19 has affected the world over time. The dashboard can be viewed at [CovidDashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidDashboard_16786412891340/Dashboard5).

## Usage
To run the data analysis and dashboard, simply open the Tableau Public dashboard link provided above. To view the data cleaning process, navigate to the "Data Cleaning.ipynb" file in the Python files folder.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the impact of COVID-19 on the world, and the dashboard provides a clear visual representation of the data. By utilizing Python and Tableau Public, we were able to clean and analyze the data effectively, and display the results in an accessible format.
